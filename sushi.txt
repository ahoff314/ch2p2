Write a program that prompts the capacity, in gallons, of an automobile fuel tank and
 the miles per gallon the automobile can be driven.
 The program outputs the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
 Numbers entered for capacity must allow entry of capacity being
 an integer and the miles per gallon in decimals.
The number of miles must be output to the next lowest integer (without decimals).

1) Receive the input of the tank capacity in gallons (integer)

2) Receive the input of the miles per gallon for the car (allow decimals)

3) Calculate the number of miles the car can be driven without refueling using the below formula

    totalMiles = tankCapacity * milesPerGallon

4) Output totalMiles (next lowest integer)
